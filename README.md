# React-Django-Heroku Web App Deployment

## Introduction

This is a simple Todo web application built using **React.js (front-end)** and **Django (back-end)**.

There are mainly **two ways** you can deploy this kind of web app:

1. **Separating Back-end and Front-end:**
   In this method, you **serve your back-end and front-end apps separately** and they **connect to each other with their respective URIs**. One major overead of this approach is you have to **configure CORS yourself**. More about CORS will be explained later in the guide.

2. **Serving from the same host:**
   In this method you will be **serving the app from the same URI** so it **removes the CORS overhead**. Also, it makes it easier to maintain smaller-medium sized apps. You don't want to create two separate repositories for some simple sites like a blog, to-do etc.

   This method requires building the React app first (npm run build) and update both the Django views (views.py) and urls (urls.py) to render the index.html template directly. 

For this guide, we will be demonstrating this longer, more complex but more flexible approach for a simple todo app. I will try out this second, easier method in the future.<br>

# Method 1: Separating Back-end and Front-end

## Setting up the Backend

### 1. Create new project directory

```
$ mkdir (DIR_NAME)
$ cd (DIR_NAME)
``` 

### 2. Install dependencies
Run the following command inside your virtual environment:

- Using **pipenv**:
    ```Shell
    $ pipenv install -r requirements.txt # (Python 2)
    $ pipenv3 install -r requirements.txt # (Python 3)
    ``` 
- Using **venv**:
    ```Shell
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt # (Python 2)
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt # (Python 3)
    ``` 

### 3. Create new Django project
Run the following command inside your virtual environment:
```Shell
$ django-admin startproject backend
``` 

### 4. Extract all Django project files to root directory (recommended)
The directory should look as follows:
```
.
├── README.md
├── backend
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── __pycache__
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
├── db.sqlite3
├── manage.py
```
### 5. Create new Django app
First, **navigate** into the newly created backend folder. Then, **start a new Django app**, in this case called ```todo``` since we want to create a todo app. We will also **run migrations** and **start up the server**:

```Shell
$ cd backend
$ python manage.py startapp todo
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py runserver
``` 

If everything works well, we should see an instance of a Django application running on this address — http://localhost:8000

![alt text](https://scotch-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1542486456/ia8jlkozut4uxwatnqwp.png)

### 6. Register new Django app

Open the ```backend/settings.py``` file and update the ```INSTALLED_APPS``` section as so:

```Python
# backend/settings.py

# Application definition
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'todo' # Add this
]
``` 

### 7. Set up the APIs

In order to allow for **API CRUD operations** between both front and back end, we need to utilise the **Django REST Framework** as well as **Django CORS Headers**.

**Django REST framework** is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs, while **Django CORS Headers** is a Django app for handling the server headers required for **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**.

The image below essentially sums up the application architecture of a React-Django stack web app:
![alt text](https://bezkoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/django-react-axios-rest-framework-crud-architecture.png)

* Django exports REST APIs using Django REST Framework and interacts with Database using Django Model.
* React Client sends HTTP Requests and retrieve HTTP Responses using axios, shows data on the components.


After installing all the necessary requirements in Step 2, we need to add ```rest_framework``` and ```corsheaders``` to the list of installed applications, so open the ```backend/settings.py``` file and update the ```INSTALLED_APPS``` and ```MIDDLEWARE``` sections accordingly:

```Python
# backend/settings.py

# Application definition
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'corsheaders',                              # add this
    'rest_framework',                           # add this
    'todo',
  ]

MIDDLEWARE = [
    'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',    # add this
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
]
``` 

At the bottom of the ```backend/settings.py``` file, you need to choose to add either the following:

```Python
# # Whitelist localhost:3000 because that's where frontend will be served

# Option 1
CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST = [
    'https://localhost:3000',
]

# Option 2
CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True
``` 

* ```CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL```: If True, all origins will be accepted (not use the whitelist below). **Defaults to False**.
* ```CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST```: List of origins that are authorized to make cross-site HTTP requests. **Defaults to []**.

### 8. Creating serializers for the Django model and views

We need serializers to **convert model instances to JSON** so that the frontend can work with the received data easily. We will create a ```todo/serializers.py``` file:

```Shell
touch todo/serializers.py
``` 

Open the ```todo/serializers.py``` file and update it with the following code:

```Python
# todo/serializers.py
from rest_framework import serializers # This is important
from .models import Todo

class TodoSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Todo
        fields = ('id', 'title', 'description', 'completed')
```

For any type of Django app, you can configure its own model as long as serializers are imported and  ```serializers.ModelSerializer``` model class parameter is defined.

For the views in ```todo/views.py```:

```Python
# todo/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from rest_framework import viewsets          # add this
from .serializers import TodoSerializer      # add this
from .models import Todo                     # add this

class TodoView(viewsets.ModelViewSet):       # add this
    serializer_class = TodoSerializer          # add this
    queryset = Todo.objects.all()              # add this
```

The **viewsets base class** provides the implementation for CRUD operations by default, what we had to do was specify the serializer class and the query set.

Finally, we need to **update** the ```backend/urls.py```:

```Python
# backend/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include                   # add this
from rest_framework import routers                      # add this
from todo import views                                  # add this

router = routers.DefaultRouter()                        # add this
router.register(r'todos', views.TodoView, 'todo')       # add this

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),         
    path('api/', include(router.urls))                   # add this
]
```

The router class allows us to make the following queries:

* ```/todos/``` - This returns a **list of all the Todo items** (Create and Read operations can be done here).
* ```/todos/id``` - this returns a **single Todo item** using the ```id``` primary key (Update and Delete operations can be done here).<br><br>

## Setting up the Frontend

### 1. Create a new React application

Once Node.js is installed,  you can quick start **creating your first React app** by using the following commands:

```Shell
$ npx create-react-app frontend
$ cd my-app
$ npm start
``` 

In this case, the app we are creating is called ```frontend``` to compliment the Django's ```backend``` project name. This will take a few minutes to complete.

When everything is done, a **new folder will be created** with the following directory tree:

```Shell
.
├── README.md
├── backend
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── __pycache__
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
├── db.sqlite3
├── manage.py
└── frontend
    ├── README.md
    ├── node_modules
    ├── package.json
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── public
    │   ├── favicon.ico
    │   ├── index.html
    │   └── manifest.json
    └── src
        ├── App.css
        ├── App.js
        ├── App.test.js
        ├── index.css
        ├── index.js
        ├── logo.svg
        └── reportWebVitals.js
        └── setupTests.js
```
### 2. Extract all React project files to root directory (recommended)
In order to make things much easier later in the process, you are **advised** to **move all the files** inside  ```frontend``` to the **root directory** (same level as  ```backend/``` folder) as follows:

```Shell
.
├── README.md
├── backend
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── __pycache__
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
├── db.sqlite3
├── manage.py
├── node_modules
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── public
├── requirements.txt
├── runtime.txt
├── src
└── todo
```

### 3. Develop your React application
For this step, it is entirely up to you on how you are going to develop your React application. You can **refer to the React codes included** inside my **GitHub repository** (```react-dj-todoapp```) as reference.

### 4. Connecting Django with React using axios
For us to make requests to the API endpoints on the Django back-end server, we will need install a JavaScript library called ```axios```.

```axios``` is a popular, promise-based HTTP client that sports an easy-to-use API and can be used in both the browser and Node.js. For more information regarding ```axios```, you can read them **[here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-axios-react)**.


First, we need to install ```axios``` using NPM:

```Shell
$ npm install axios
```

Once ```axios``` is successfully installed, head over to the ```package.json``` file and add a **proxy** like so:

```JSON
// package.json

[...]       
"name": "frontend",
"version": "0.1.0",
"private": true,
"proxy": "http://localhost:8000",
"dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.18.0",
    "bootstrap": "^4.1.3",
    "react": "^16.5.2",
    "react-dom": "^16.5.2",
    "react-scripts": "2.0.5",
    "reactstrap": "^6.5.0"
},
[...]
```

The proxy will help in **tunnelling API requests** to http://localhost:8000 where the Django application will handle them, so we can simplify writing the requests like this in React:

```JavaScript
axios.get("/api/todos/")
```
Instead of this:

```JavaScript
axios.get("http://localhost:8000/api/todos/")
```

After that, you need to **modify the React codes** (```App.js ```)

Here's a snippet on how to use ```axios```:

```JavaScript
// src/App.js

handleSubmit = item => {
    this.toggle();
    if (item.id) {
    axios
        .put(`http://localhost:8000/api/todos/${item.id}/`, item)
        .then(res => this.refreshList());
    return;
    }
    axios
      .post("http://localhost:8000/api/todos/", item)
      .then(res => this.refreshList());
};

handleDelete = item => {
    axios
        .delete(`http://localhost:8000/api/todos/${item.id}`)
        .then(res => this.refreshList());
};
```

For further information and example, please refer to this **[Digital Ocean guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-axios-react)**. 

### 5. Test the Web Application
You can check whether everything is working by **running both React and Django concurrently** at your local development server:

```Shell
$ npm start
$ python manage.py runserver
``` 

Test whether both the UI and API requests are working or not. <br><br>

## Deploying the Web App using Heroku

### 1. Set up Heroku account and CLI

Here is an **outline** following Heroku's from-product-to-productionized instructions for a Django deployment to Heroku:

1. **Signup** for **[Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/)** if you don't have an existing account
2. **Install** the **[Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)**. For MacOS, use ```$ brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku```:
3. **Log in** to your Heroku account by entering your credentials using ```$ heroku login```:
4. **Create** a n**ew Heroku app** either via Heroku CLI (```$ heroku create APP_NAME```) or directly in the **[Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com)**:

    ![alt text](https://alphacoder.xyz/images/dply-dj/heroku-dashboard.png)
    ![alt text](https://alphacoder.xyz/images/dply-dj/link-app-to-heroku.png)
    

5. **Add** the **Heroku remote** via ```$ heroku git:remote -a your-heroku-app.```
6. **Configure** the **Heroku buildpacks**
    
    * The React app build process depends on NPM, so we need Node.js. We also need Python to run Django.

    * Heroku uses **buildpacks** to **transform deployed code into slugs** which can be executed by Dynos (server instances on Heroku). We’ll be needing two buildpacks. One for Node and another for Python.

    * Our app would run on a Python server, even though we will use Node/NPM to build/bundle the React frontend. So the Python buildpack will be the main one in our config. The main buildpack determines the process type of the Heroku app. You can read about multiple buildpacks to understand how they work.

    * You can add buildpacks via the Heroku CLI. Head back to your terminal and run the following to set/add the buildpacks we need:

    ```Shell
    $ heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs
    $ heroku buildpacks:add --index 2 heroku/python
    ``` 
    
    * Note that the buildpacks **must be added in that order**. We can see the buildpacks we’ve added by running ```$ heroku buildpacks```. The **last buildpack** on the list **determines the process type** of the app.

    ![alt text](https://alphacoder.xyz/images/dply-dj/buildpacks.png)

7. Configure **PostgreSQL Heroku addon**
   
    * During production, Heroku will **not be using SQLite database**. Instead, we need to use **PostgreSQL** by configuring the addon to our app using ```$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev```
    * You can check whether this is successful by running ```$ heroku config```:
    
     ```Shell
    $ === APP_NAME Config Vars
    DATABASE_URL: postgres://[DATABASE_INFO_HERE]
    ``` 

    * The database info from the code snippet above refers to the URL containing your database’s location and access credentials all in one. Anyone with this URL can access your database, so be careful with it.
    * You will notice that Heroku saves it as an **environment variable** called ```DATABASE_URL``` . This URL can and does change, so you should never hard code it. Instead, we’ll use the variable ```DATABASE_URL``` in  Django.

8. Configure **Heroku config variables**

    * According to Heroku, **config variables** are environment variables that can change the way your app behaves. In addition to creating your own, some add-ons come with their own.
    * There are several environment variables that need to be set:

    ```Shell
    $ heroku config:set ALLOWED_HOSTS=APP_NAME.herokuapp.com
    $ heroku config:set ALLOWED_HOSTS=APP_NAME.herokuapp.com
    $ heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=DJANGO_SECRET_KEY
    $ heroku config:set WEB_CONCURRENCY=1
    ```

9. Import ```django-heroku``` inside ```settings.py```

    * ```django-heroku``` is a **Django library** for Heroku applications that ensures a more seamless deployment and development experience.
    * This library provides:
        * **Settings configuration** (Static files / WhiteNoise)
        * **Logging configuration**
        * **Test runner** (important for Heroku CI)
    * In ```settings.py```, include the following at the very bottom:
  
    ```Python
    # backend/settings.py

    # Configure Django App for Heroku.
    import django_heroku
    django_heroku.settings(locals())
    ``` 
<br>

### 2. Configure the Django back-end side

### Database Configuration

#### A. Create .env
As mentioned above, the local version of the Django app is using db.sqlite3 as its database. However, when we visit the Heroku version, ```APP_NAME.herokuapp.com```, Heroku will need to use a PostgreSQL database instead.

What we want to do is to get our app running with SQLite whenever we’re working on it locally, and with Postgres whenever it’s in production. This can be done using the installed ```python-dotenv``` library.

We will then use a file called ```.env``` to tell Django to use SQLite when running locally. To create ```.env``` and have it point Django to your SQLite database:

```Shell
    $ echo 'DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3' > .env
``` 

Include the ```.env``` file inside our .gitignore when pushing to Heroku by running the following command:

```Shell
    $ echo '.env' >> .gitignore
``` 

#### B. Update settings.py

First, **import** the necessary libraries for deployment purposes:

```Python
# backend/settings.py

import django_heroku
import dotenv
import dj_database_url
``` 

Next, we need to set up the **database** configuration:

```Python
# backend/settings.py

# Build paths inside the project like this: BASE_DIR / 'subdir'.
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().root.root

dotenv_file = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, ".env")
if os.path.isfile(dotenv_file):
    dotenv.load_dotenv(dotenv_file)

``` 

Since ```.env``` won’t exist on Heroku, ```dotenv.load_dotenv(dotenv_file)``` will never get called on Heroku and Heroku will proceed to try to find its own database — PostgreSQL.

We also need to configure the ```DATABASES``` setting as shown below:

```Python
# backend/settings.py

DATABASES = {}
DATABASES['default'] = dj_database_url.config(conn_max_age=600)

``` 

The idea here is to clear the ```DATABASES``` variable and then set the ```'default'``` key using the ```dj_database_url``` module. This module uses Heroku’s ```DATABASE_URL``` variable if it’s on Heroku, or it uses the ```DATABASE_URL``` we set in the ```.env``` file if we’re working locally.

If you ran the Django application as specified above, you might get an error when working locally because the ```dj_database_url``` module wants to log in with SSL. Heroku Postgres requires SSL, but SQLite doesn’t need or expect it. Here's how to fix that:

```Python
# backend/settings.py

# This should already be in your settings.py
django_heroku.settings(locals())

# Add these at the very last line of settings.py
options = DATABASES['default'].get('OPTIONS', {})
options.pop('sslmode', None)
``` 

Test everything out by running the local Django server using ```python3 manage.py runserver```.

### Static files serve (WhiteNoise)

#### A. WhiteNoise settings

**[WhiteNoise](http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/)** allows your web app to **serve its own static files**, making it a self-contained unit that can be deployed anywhere without relying on nginx, Amazon S3 or any other external service. (Especially useful on Heroku, OpenShift and other PaaS providers.)

Since this is already installed from the ```requirements.txt``` file earlier on, we need to update ```settings.py```:


```Python
# backend/settings.py

MIDDLEWARE = [
  'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
  'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
  # ...
]

STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
``` 

#### B. Static files and template settings

In order to correctly serve the static files from both Django and React, we need to **update** the following in ```settings.py```:

```Python
# backend/settings.py

STATIC_URL = '/static/'

STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'build/static')
]
   
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
``` 

```STATIC_ROOT``` points to the directory containing all the static files, while ```STATICFILES_DIRS``` refers to other directories where Django will collect the static files as well. In this case, it is pointing to React's ```'build/static'``` directory which contains the static files for frontend when Heroku builds the React app using ```npm run build``` during deployment.

Therefore, when Heroku runs ```python3 manage.py collectstatic``` during deployment, it will automatically compile all the static files from both React and Django.

Meanwhile for Django's template directory, we need to include the React ```build``` directory which stores the ```index.html``` inside ```TEMPLATES``` as follows:

```Python
# backend/settings.py

TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'build')],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
        },
    },
]
``` 

#### C. Static files MIME Type issue

Upon deploying the web app in Heroku, one of the common issues that occur is the **static files failing to load due to MIME type limitations**. The particular MIME type (```text/html```) problem is related to your Django configuration.

The ```views.py``` in your React frontend needs a ```content_type``` argument in the ```HttpResponse```.
Heroku needs to know where the static files are.

The "refused to execute script ... MIME type ('text/html')" problem stems from Django's default ```content_type``` setting for an ```HttpResponse```, which is ```text/html```.

This can be fixed by including a ```content_type='application/javascript'``` argument in the return statement of a new class-based view called ```Assets(View)``` inside ```views.py``` like so:

```Python
# todo/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from rest_framework import viewsets
from .serializers import TodoSerializer
from .models import Todo
from django.views import View
from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseNotFound
import os

# The viewsets base class provides the implementation for CRUD operations by default,
# what we had to do was specify the serializer class and the query set.
class TodoView(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    serializer_class = TodoSerializer
    queryset = Todo.objects.all()

# Add this CBV
class Assets(View):

    def get(self, _request, filename):
        path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'static', filename)

        if os.path.isfile(path):
            with open(path, 'rb') as file:
                return HttpResponse(file.read(), content_type='application/javascript')
        else:
            return HttpResponseNotFound()

```
<br>

### 3. Debug and Access

During production, it is strongly recommended that ```DEBUG``` is set to ```False```. 

For ```ALLOWED_HOSTS```, if you set ```CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL``` to ```True```:

```Python
# backend/settings.py

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*'] # Set to open for all access
``` 

Else, you need to specify the URL access permissions as follows:

```Python
# backend/settings.py

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['react-dj-todoapp.herokuapp.com', '127.0.0.1:8000', 'localhost']
``` 
<br>

### 4. Configure the React front-end side

#### A. Configure package.json

For React deployment using Heroku, there are a few changes needed to be made inside the ```package.json```:

```JSON
// package.json

// Add homepage and engine settings

{

#### B. Fix Django's CSRF token verification conflict

The **built-in CSRF protection** provided by Django is very useful to **protect your server from malicious websites** that can exploit your visitor browser to attack you. However, when using modern JavaScript libraries you will need to handle CSRF differently.

Referring back to the first part of the ```README.md```, because React and Django apps use different URL and port number, Django's CSRF token verification mechanism will prevent React from executing any API requests to Django during production.

To solve this, we need to tell ```axios``` to handle CSRF tokens in React. For ```axios``` client you have **three** options:

* Manually attach the CSRF token in the header of each Axios call
* Use the ```Axios``` ```xsrfHeaderName``` for each call
* Use a default ```xsrfHeaderName (axios.defaults.xsrfHeaderName = "X-CSRFToken")```

Here is how you can simply use the CSRF token with Axios without any further configuration:

```JavaScript
// src/App.js

import axios from 'axios';

axios.defaults.xsrfCookieName = 'csrftoken'
axios.defaults.xsrfHeaderName = 'X-CSRFToken'
```

### 5. Set up Heroku-specific files

#### A. runtime.txt

Heroku will install a default Python version if you don't specify one, but if you want to pick your Python version, you'll need a ```runtime.txt``` file. 

**Create one** in the **root directory**, next to your ```requirements.txt```, ```manage.py```, ```.gitignore``` and the rest. **Specify your Python version** with the prefix ```python-``` that you want your application to run on:

```Shell
python-3.9.0
``` 

#### B. requirements.txt

When deploying the web app, Heroku will need to **install all the required dependencies** for the web app to run by referring to the ```requirements.txt``` file. 

To ensure that all dependencies are included, consider freezing your dependencies using the command ```$ pip freeze > requirements.txt```. This will make your build a little bit more predictable by locking your exact dependency versions into your Git repo. If your dependencies aren't locked, you might find yourself deploying one version of Django one day and a new one the next.

#### C. Procfile

Heroku apps include a Heroku-specific ```Procfile``` that specifies the processes our application should run. The processes specified in this file will automatically boot on deploy to Heroku. 

Create a file named ```Procfile``` in the root level directory using ```$ touch Procfile``` command, right next to your ```requirements.txt``` and ```runtime.txt``` files. **(Make sure to capitalize the P of Procfile otherwise Heroku might not recognize it!)**:

Then, fill in the codes below:

```Shell
release: python manage.py migrate
web: gunicorn backend.wsgi --log-file -
``` 
<br>

### 6. Commit and Push

Once all the previous steps are completed, we are ready to **finally commit and push all changes**:

```Shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "blah blah blah"
$ git push heroku master
``` 

After the build is done and your app has been released, visit ```YOUR-APP-NAME.herokuapp.com```.<br><br>


### 7. Database Syncing

Upon successful deployment, one of the expected problems that may arise is the **500 Server Error** or the following error:

```
ProgrammingError at /
relation "TABLE_NAME" does not exist
```

This error can be resolved by running ```$ python3 manage.py migrate --run-syncdb``` using **Heroku run bash**:

```Shell
$ heroku run python3 manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
``` 

And if everything goes well up to this point, **congratulations!** You have successfully deployed your first React-Django web app!<br><br>


### 8. Debugging

If everything *did not go well*, you can use the ```$ heroku logs --tail``` to investigate any errors.<br>
