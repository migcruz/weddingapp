                    Miguel and Jessica met 10 years ago during an information session to join the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle engineering at SFU. As engineering nerds and UAV enthusiasts, Jessica and Miguel bonded as classmates, teammates, and friends. After many late nights studying and weekends spent working on the UAV, it was no surprise to Jessica when Miguel finally asked her to be his girlfriend. She, of course, enthusiastically accepted.
